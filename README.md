# Newton-Raphson-Implementation

The **Newtonâ€“Raphson method**, named after **Isaac Newton** and **Joseph Raphson**, is
a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better approximations
to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.

Newton method is iterative the more we iterate the closer the approximation gets.

We first start with a initial guess(this could be any number).
We take our original function and substitute our guess.
Then we divide it by its derivative
and substract the result from our guess.

The more we get closer to actual value
the Subtrahend gets closer to zero.

For example:
```
//for the polynomial x^2 -5 = 0
double guess = 2;
for(int i=0; i<MAX_ITERATION; ++i) {
    guess -= (guess*guess-5) / (2*guess);
}
printf("%lf\n", guess);
```

Instead of iterating for a definite times
this program checks the Subtrahend for each iteration.
When the Subtrahend gets closer to a certain threshold,
we stop iterating.
